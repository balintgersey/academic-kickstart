I was teaching instructor for the following courses: 
<ul>
<li> MFF: I am teaching assistant for the Mathematical Foundations for Finance course in the academic year 2018-2019 at ETH Zurich.

 Information on all courses and Q&A sessions of Group 3 of D-MATH can be found on the group homepage <a href = "https://people.math.ethz.ch/~gruppe3/about" target = "_blank"> here <\a>. 
 

The link to the homepage of MFF course can be found <a href = "https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/hs/401-3913-01L" target = "_blank"> here <\a>.


Lecture notes for the course Probability Theory that might also be of use to some of you can be obtained in an electronic form on the homepage of the course - https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/hs/401-3601-00L/ with the password you received by mail from the course coordinator. 

Additionally I encourage you to look at the lectures notes of the Probability and Measure course offered at the University of Cambridge. The notes can be downloaded from Professor James Norris's website: 


<li> MATHGUID: Tutored a multicultural group of around 20 first-year students delivering weekly practical sessions in Mathematics, ULB</li>
