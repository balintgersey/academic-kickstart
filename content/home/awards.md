Solving problems allowed me to approach the activity of the researcher and to perceive mathematics as a living
science. Additionally, because their resolution often requires more than routine, problems develop the ability to
control new situations. During my academic career, I had the privilege to receive several sholarships and awards from leading academic insitutions and private companies.  
<ul>
<li> PhD (DPhil) scholarship from the <a href = "https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-finance"> Mathematical and Computational Finance Group </a> at <a href = "http://www.ox.ac.uk/"> Oxford University </a>. The scholarship was complemented by an additional support from <a href = "https://www.instadeep.com/"> InstaDeep </a>. InstaDeep offers a host of AI solutions, ranging from optimized pattern-recognition, GPU-accelerated insights, to self-learning decision making systems.</li>
  
<li> ??? Prize: received a prize and sholarship for achieving a first class degree from <a href = "https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/> Fitzwilliam College </a>, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/"> University of Cambridge </a> </li>
<li> EPFL Excellence scholarship: I was accepted at EPFL’s master’s in financial engineering with an Excellence Fellowship, <a href ="https://www.epfl.ch/"> Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne </a> </li>

<li> Paris Graduate School of Mathematics: I am one of the ten laureates worldwide who was honoured to receive a <a href = "https://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/pgsm-249.htm"> Paris Graduate School of Mathematics scholarship </a> from the <a href = "https://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/"> Fondation Science Mathématique de Paris </a>. This award supported my Master 1 studies at the Pierre and Marie Curie (Sorbonne) University. </li>

<li> Jacques Hadamard: The Jacques Hadamard M1 degree program has a twofold aim: to offer a very wide range of top-level courses in all areas of mathematics, and enable students to discover mathematical research from within by exposing them to live, current problems.
It is intended for double-degree students: second-year students on the "Magistère" (vocational Master's) in mathematics at Orsay, second-year mathematics students at ENS Cachan, as well as certain students on further mathematics programs at the École Polytechnique.
However this selective program is also open to motivated student (french or not) with a very good level in mathematics. </li>
