Solving problems allowed me to approach the activity of the researcher and to perceive mathematics as a living
science. Additionally, because their resolution often requires more than routine, problems develop the ability to
control new situations. During my academic career, I had the privilege to receive several sholarships and awards from leading academic insitutions and private companies.  
<ul>
<li> PhD (DPhil) scholarship from the <a href = "https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-finance"> Mathematical and Computational Finance Group </a> at <a href = "http://www.ox.ac.uk/"> Oxford University </a>. The scholarship was complemented by an additional support from <a href = "https://www.instadeep.com/"> InstaDeep </a>. InstaDeep offers a host of AI solutions, ranging from optimized pattern-recognition, GPU-accelerated insights, to self-learning decision making systems.</li>
  
<li> ??? Prize: received a prize and sholarship for achieving a first class degree from <a href = "https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/> Fitzwilliam College </a>, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/"> University of Cambridge </a> </li>
<li> EPFL Excellence scholarship: I was accepted at EPFL’s master’s in financial engineering with an Excellence Fellowship, <a href ="https://www.epfl.ch/"> Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne </a> </li>

<li> Paris Graduate School of Mathematics: I am one of the ten laureates worldwide who was honoured to receive a <a href = "https://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/pgsm-249.htm"> Paris Graduate School of Mathematics scholarship </a> from the <a href = "https://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/"> Fondation Science Mathématique de Paris </a>. The Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris is an excellence network in mathematics and fundamental computer science in Paris founded by leading french academic institutions including  the national center for science <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/> CNRS </a>, the <a href = "http://www.ens.fr/> Ecole Normale Supérieur </a> (Ulm) and the <a href = "https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/> Sorbonne University </a>. This award supported my Master 1 studies at the Pierre and Marie Curie (Sorbonne) University. </li>

<li> Jacques Hadamard scholarship: The Jacques Hadamard M1 degree program has a twofold aim: to offer a very wide range of top-level courses in all areas of mathematics, and enable students to discover mathematical research from within by exposing them to live, current problems.
The Fondation Jacques Hadamard includes the <a href ="https://www.polytechnique.edu/"> Ecole Polytechnique </a>, the <a href = "http://ens-paris-saclay.fr/"> Ecole Normale Supérieur (Cachan) </a> and the <a href ="http://www.u-psud.fr/fr/index.html> University Paris Sud </a>.</li>

<li> <a href ="https://www.komal.hu/home.h.shtml> Komal </a> Hungarian Mathematics and Physics Competition </li>
