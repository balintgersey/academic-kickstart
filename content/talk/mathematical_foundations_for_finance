Information on all courses and Q&A sessions of Group 3 of D-MATH can be found on the group homepage - <a href = "https://people.math.ethz.ch/~gruppe3/about">. The link to the homepage of MFF can be found there as well - <a href = "https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/hs/401-3913-01L">.


Lecture notes for the course Probability Theory that might also be of use to some of you can be obtained in an electronic form on the homepage of the course - https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/hs/401-3601-00L/ with the following password: mart2018.

Additionally I encourag you to look at the lectures notes of the Probability and Measure course offered at the University of Cambridge. The notes can be downloaded from Professor James Norris's website:
